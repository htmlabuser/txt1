AWS Glue Data Quality - AWS GlueAWS Glue Data Quality - AWS GlueAWSDocumentationAWS GlueDeveloper GuideBenefits and key featuresHow it worksConsiderationsTerminologyRelease notes for AWS Glue Data QualityAWS Glue Data QualityAWS Glue Data Quality allows you to measure and monitor the quality of your data so that you can make
        good business decisions. Built on top of the open-source DeeQu framework, AWS Glue Data Quality provides a
        managed, serverless experience. AWS Glue Data Quality works with Data Quality Definition Language (DQDL),
        which is a domain specific language that you use to define data quality rules. To learn more
        about DQDL and supported rule types, see Data Quality Definition Language (DQDL) reference.For additional product details and pricing, see the service page for AWS Glue Data Quality.
Benefits and key features



Serverless - there is no installation, patching or maintenance.



Get started quickly - AWS Glue Data Quality quickly analyzes your data and creates data quality rules for you.
                    You can get started with two clicks: "Create Data Quality Rules -> Recommend rules".



Improvise your rules - with 25+ out-of-the-box DQ rules to start from, you can create rules
                    that suit your specific needs.



Evaluate quality and make confident business decisions - Once you evaluate the rules,
                    you get a Data Quality score that provides an overview of the health of your data.
                    Use Data Quality score to make confident business decisions.



Zero in on bad data - AWS Glue Data Quality helps you identify the exact records that caused your
                    quality scores to go down. Easily identify them, quarantine and fix them.



Pay as you go - There are no annual licenses you need to use AWS Glue Data Quality



No lock-in - AWS Glue Data Quality is built on open source DeeQu, allowing you to keep the rules you are
                    authoring in an open language.



Data quality checks - AWS Glue Data Quality You can enforce data quality checks on Data Catalog
                    and AWS Glue ETL pipelines allowing you to manage data quality at rest and in transit.


How it works
There are two entry points for AWS Glue Data Quality: the AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Glue ETL jobs. This
            section provides an overview of the use cases and AWS Glue features that each entry point
            supports.
Data
                    quality for the AWS Glue Data Catalog
AWS Glue Data Quality evaluates objects that are stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog It offers non-coders an easy way to set up data quality rules.
These personas include data stewards and business analysts.
You might choose this option for the following use cases:


You want to perform data quality tasks on data sets that you've already
                        cataloged in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

You work on data governance and need to identify or evaluate data quality
                        issues in your data lake on an ongoing basis.

You can manage data quality for the Data Catalog using the following interfaces:


The AWS Glue management console

AWS Glue APIs

To get started with AWS Glue Data Quality for the AWS Glue Data Catalog see Getting started with
            AWS Glue Data Quality for the Data Catalog.
Data quality for AWS Glue ETL jobs
AWS Glue Data Quality for AWS Glue ETL jobs lets you perform proactive data quality tasks. Proactive tasks help you identify and
                filter out bad data before you load a data set
                into your data lake.



You might choose data quality for ETL jobs for the following use cases:


You want to incorporate data quality tasks into your ETL jobs

You want to write code that defines data quality tasks in ETL
                        scripts

You want to manage the quality of data that flows in your visual data
                        pipelines

You can manage data quality for ETL jobs using the following interfaces:


AWS Glue Studio, AWS Glue Studio notebooks, and AWS Glue interactive sessions

AWS Glue libraries for ETL scripting

AWS Glue APIs

To get started with data quality for ETL jobs, see Tutorial: Getting started with
                    Data Quality in the AWS Glue Studio User
                Guide.
Comparing data quality for the Data Catalog
                    to data quality for ETL jobs

Considerations

Data quality rules can't evaluate nested or list-type data sources.

Terminology

The following list defines terms that are related to AWS Glue Data Quality.

Data Quality Definition Language (DQDL)

A domain-specific language that you can use to write AWS Glue Data Quality rules.
To learn more about DQDL, see the Data Quality Definition Language (DQDL) reference guide.

data quality

Describes how well a dataset serves its specific purpose. AWS Glue Data Quality
                        evaluates rules against a dataset to measure data quality. Each rule checks
                        for particular characteristics like data freshness or integrity. To quantify
                        data quality, you can use a data quality
                            score.

data quality score

The percentage of data quality rules that pass (result in true) when you
                        evaluate a ruleset with AWS Glue Data Quality.

rule

A DQDL expression that checks your data for a specific characteristic and
                        returns a Boolean value. For more information, see Rule structure.

ruleset

An AWS Glue resource that comprises a set of data quality rules. A ruleset
                        must be associated with a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. When you save a ruleset,
                        AWS Glue assigns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the ruleset.
